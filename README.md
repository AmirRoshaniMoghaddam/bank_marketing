Capstone poject for concordia bootcamp


# Proposal:

For the capstone project I will be doing a classification project. The data that I will use is taken from University of Californai Irvine machine learning repository; and it is named 'Bank Marketing Data Set'. The data includes around 20 features, and over 40,000 thousands of instances. The features are a mix of numerical and categorical data. The aim of the project is to buil an algorithm to predict if the client would subscribe (yes or no question) a term doposit (dependent variable).

To achieve the aformentioned goal, I will be using a number of different methods on the dataset. The premilinary lists of the model that I will be using are: logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines and neural networks (if time allows). The data is already cleaned; however, to select the best features, I will use some of the feature engineering techniques that have been taught in this bootcamp.
